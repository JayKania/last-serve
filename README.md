# LastServe

Restaurants that have leftover food will update their public posting on our website each night with how much food is still available. Anyone in need of food can do so by setting up a time slot and coming to pick up their meal for that evening. By doing this, food waste in restaurants will be reduced and people won't go to bed hungry.

## Sources Used

### SignupRestaurant.js

\*Lines 31, 157

```
const navigate = useNavigate();
navigate('/approvalPending');

```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [bobbyhadz](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/react-redirect-after-form-submit) as shown below:

```
const navigate = useNavigate();

const handleSubmit = event => {
    event.preventDefault();

    // üëáÔ∏è redirect to /contacts
    navigate('/contacts');
  };

```

The code in [bobbyhadz](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/react-redirect-after-form-submit) was implemented to route user to contacts page when he submit form. The code was used because somewhat similar requirement was there like on submitting form wanted to redirect user on other page. The code was modified by just using required navigate function with actual page routing which was ApprovalPending page in our case.

### App.js

_Lines 27 - 29_

```
<BrowserRouter>
      <Route path="/signupRestaurant" element={<SignupRestaurant />} />
       <Route path="/approvalPending" element={<RestaurantApprovalPending />} />
       <Route path="/restaurantSideBar" element={<RestaurantSideBar />} />
  </BrowserRouter>

```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [dev](https://dev.to/emmanuelthecoder/getting-started-with-react-router-19de) as shown below:

```
<BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<App />} >
        <Route path="users" element={<Users/>} />
        <Route path ="posts" element={<Posts />} />
        <Route path="*" element={<h1>Route does not exist</h1>}/>
      </Routes>
  </BrowserRouter>

```

The code in [dev](https://dev.to/emmanuelthecoder/getting-started-with-react-router-19de) was implemented to route user on different pages.The code was used because same functionality was required in application. The code was modified by replacing application component and route at required places.

### src/components/RestaurantVolunteer/RestaurantVolunteer.jsx

_Lines 136 - 142_

```
    <div class="dashboard-content">
        <DataTable
            columns={columns}
            data={data}
            pagination
        />
    </div>


```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [React Datatable documentation ](https://jbetancur.github.io/react-data-table-component/?path=/docs/pagination-basic--basic&globals=outline:true) as shown below:

```

() => <DataTable title="Movie List" columns={columns} data={data} pagination />


```

- <!---How---> The code in [React Datatable documentation ](https://jbetancur.github.io/react-data-table-component/?path=/docs/pagination-basic--basic&globals=outline:true) was implemented by jbetancur
- <!---Why---> [React Datatable documentation ](https://jbetancur.github.io/react-data-table-component/?path=/docs/pagination-basic--basic&globals=outline:true)'s Code was used to use the library and create the pagination in the tables used
- <!---How---> [React Datatable documentation ](https://jbetancur.github.io/react-data-table-component/?path=/docs/pagination-basic--basic&globals=outline:true) Code was modified by using different Data and columns and using the tags separately rather than a function.
